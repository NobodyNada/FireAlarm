			"body":	"<p>I would like to know whether it is possible to do a compile time type check on a generic in rust. To clarify: I don't want to check whether a type has a certain trait but I would like to be able to differentiate between, e.g. a struct and an integer. Since both a struct and an integer can implement the same trait, I don't know how I could tell them apart.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that I want to do this is because I am using serde_json to convert a generic type to json but I <strong>only</strong> want it to become a json Object (which happens when it is a struct) but it should not convert to anything else (like an json I64). Since both structs and integers can implement the Serialize trait, there is no way to tell them apart. Currently I will just let the process panic because it is not an error it could recover from but since I could potentially know this at compile time, I am wondering whether there is any mechanism to determine the type at the compile stage.</p>\n\n<p>So in summary: I would like to know whether or how I can tell types apart by their 'kind' and not by their traits.</p>\n",

Most importantly, I want to have an Android AND iOS apps for the web (like, say, Facebook messanger). The idea is that I want the user to get instant notifications about new messages both on their web-page and the mobile app. If it hadn't been for the mobile part, I would start off delving into the jungles of <strong>Tornado + socket.io + mongoDB</strong> architecture. But before starting, I want to make sure that this architecture will be suitable not only for browser push-notifications, but also for the mobile app. I have read about <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-server-to-send-push-notifications-with-gcm-to-android-devices-using-python\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GCM</a> and Google clouding solution. \nNow the question is, </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Just in terms of conceptual categorization, Is GCM/Google clouding an <strong>ALTERNATIVE</strong> to Tornado + socket.io + mongoDB stuff or it is a <strong>COMPLEMENTARY</strong> TOOL which should be built over/next to Tornado + socket.io + mongoDB layer?</li>\n<li>Is GCM + Google clouding a working solution for commercial projects with large number of users if developed correctly</li>\n</ul>\n",

For example, Turbo Tax collects all information about taxes and then creates a tax return PDF. In my case, it's something much more simple. I'm trying to build a website that will generate a PDF with an on boarding paperwork for a new hires. The website would first collect info from a user and determine which forms to include. At my work, I have a folder with all individual PDF form (I-9 etc.) that I print one by one and spend hours organizing and putting all together. If there would be a website that will put them all together into one PDF that would be great. I'm assuming it is something that will require the use of JavaScript and possible a back end language.
